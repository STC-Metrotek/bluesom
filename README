  CB-CV-SOM FPGA default project

Synopsys
--------

  Simple almost blank FPGA project for CV-CE-SOM (aka BlueSoM)
  board.

Description
-----------

  The project makes avaible to flash on/off the orange LED on
  CB-CV-SOM board (there is only one accessible) using fpga 
  registers.

  The project contains qsys project with some standard
  Altera IP-cores (Base bus address/end bus address):
     * System ID Peripheral (the ID is 0x01000001) (0xC000_0000/0xC000_0007)
     * PIO (used to flash the LED)                 (0xC000_0010/0xC000_001f)
     * On-Chip-Memory (4KB)                        (0xC000_1000/0xC000_1fff)

  Learn more about this system via qsys.

  To flash on the LED write 1 to 0xC0000010 bus address.
  To flash off the LED write 0 to the same address.

  If it doesn't work, make sure you use the appropriate preloader binary.

Build
-----

  Use Altera Quartus-14.1 (build on other versions not tested)
  Launch it, open top.qpf and push "start compilation".

  Your .sof, .rbf will be ready in output_files/

  Build preloader:

    ! This stage shall be done only after fpga firmware building complete !

    cd hps_isw_handoff

    <your quartus path>/embedded/embedded_command_shell.sh 

    bsp-create-settings --type spl --bsp-dir build --preloader-settings-dir soc_hps_0 --settings build/settings.bsp

    make -C build
